	* makepatch.pl:
	Add fixes from Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@ThePLAnet.net>.

	"Patch 2.1 rather stupidly does *not* use the Index: lines for context
	diffs, or at best uses them as hints.  This normally isn't a problem,
	but when you have a new file in the patch, makepatch set the index
	line correctly, but the diff has /dev/null as one file, and
	dir/index-pathname for the other file, where dir is the directory
	that was specified as the new version to makepatch.
	Patch very stupidly then creates a new file in dir/index-pathname,
	rather than just index-pathname.

	"The workround I have had to use is to edit the patch after making it,
	which is a pain and leads to problems.

	"Another fix would be to fudge it a bit, and where there is a new file
	do the "diff" manually by building the Index: line, the 2 diff header
	lines, and then just reading the whole new file into an array and
	shoving it our preceded by
	"+ " using join or some such, alternatively the diff headers could be
	mangled by makepatch....
