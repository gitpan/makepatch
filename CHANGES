Overall changes in makepatch version 2.0
----------------------------------------

 * Generates a perl program that applies the patches by running the
   'patch' program. Optionally, a shell script can be generated as with
   the 1.x version.
   The generated perl program requires a normal perl5 installation and
   the 'patch' program. No other tools (like shells) are required.

   The generated perl program is the concatenation of:
    - a perl 'Patcher' program;
    - a shell preamble;
    - the actual 'patch' input.

   If running through perl fails due to perl contraints, the perl
   preamble can be stripped off and the remainder used as a shell
   script. If that fails due to shell constraints, new
   files/directories should be created manually after which the shell
   script can be fed to the 'patch' program.

 * To avoid most common problems with buggy versions of the 'patch'
   program, the patch data is relocated to the current directory. 
   This obsoletes the command line options -fixpath and -fixallpath.

   As a consequence, when a patch is generated from two directories,
   e.g.:

     makepatch src-1.0 src-1.1 > the-patch

   it must be applied *IN* the directory src-1.0, e.g.

     cd src-1.0; perl the-patch

   When fed to patch directly, no -p option must be used:

     cd src-1.0; patch < the-patch

 * The generated perl program will apply some heuristics to determine
   if it is in the correct directory before attempting to apply the
   patch.

 * The generated perl program will verify that the patch is complete,
   i.e. not truncated or currupted.

 * Program options can be specified in an environment variable, a file
   as well as on the command line.

 * Makepatch can take a standard source archive (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2,
   .tar or .zip) as input instead of the sources directories.

 * MANIFEST files are automatically used unless suppressed with the
   new -nomanifest option.
