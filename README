This is makepatch, a program to generate a patch file from two files
or directories.

It resembles "diff -c -r -N", but:

  - it is always recursive;
  - it handles 'patchlevel.h' first;
  - it supplies 'Index:' and 'Prereq:' lines;
  - it can use 'manifest' files;
  - it generates shell commands to create and remove files and directories;
  - it can manipulate manifest files.
  - it can exclude files using wildcard and regex patters.

As distributed, it assumes that perl resides in /usr/local/bin. You
have to change the first line of makepatch.pl if your perl is in a
different location.

To install: 

  - Edit Makefile.PL (if needed)
  - Type 'perl Makefile.PL'
  - Type 'make'

    blib/script/makepatch is the makepatch program
    blib/man1/makepatch.1 is the manual page

  - Type 'make install' to install the program and the documentation
    on your system. This usually requires super user privileges.
