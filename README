This is makepatch, a program to generate a patch file from two files
or directories.

It resembles "diff -c -r -N", but:

  - it is always recursive;
  - it handles 'patchlevel.h' first;
  - it supplies 'Index:' and 'Prereq:' lines;
  - it can use 'manifest' files;
  - it generates shell commands to remove files;
  - it can manipulate manifest files.

As distributed, it assumes that perl resides in /usr/local/bin. You
have to change the first line of makepatch.pl if your perl is in a
different location.

To install: edit the Makefile (if needed) and type 'make install'.
